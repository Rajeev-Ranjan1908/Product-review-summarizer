I recommend it.,I didn't get the same case that's shown in the picture. The case I got had a black and gold bow. Its still cute but not what I wanted. I wanted what was in the picture.,My teenage daughter LOVED this case.  It is really pretty.\\n\\nI only put 4 stars because it does look a little cheap looking, but what do you expect with this much bling. ;o),When you don't want to spend a whole lot of cash but want a great deal...this is the shop to buy from!,I liked it because it was cute, but the studs fall off easily and to protect a phone this would not be recommended. Buy if you just like it for looks.,It's very cute and the stones lasted a long time!  It really makes your phone look a lot more prettier and funnier.,the hirl that wants and needs Hello Kitty products\\nWas so happy that she has a collection to choose from\\nall her friends wants hello kitty phone cases to\\nthanks seller,so cute love this...one drop and its done though...i dropped iton the bathroom floor and it cracked. other then that item is very cute,this case is so cute it looks good on my white iphone its pretty good quality only one diamond has fallen off and its cos i dropped it on the cement. its kinda hard to get off but whatever its so cute and hot and everyone compliments me on it,Happy it,This case is very pretty.  It is very girly looking.  The only problem is it will be hard to put the case in a jeans pocket because the bow does stick out.  It would not be a problem for me as I carry mine in my purse, but my daughters put their phones in their pockets.  Shipping was as described.,Cute case. Jewels do come off but what do you expect. Mine has held up pretty nicely and lost a few stones but is barely noticeable.,Got this for a friend who saw this and liked it. i got it for her, and she liked it. looks good on your iphone and fits well too,it is a beautiful phone case but its also hard to remove &amp; also it the 3d ribbon came wasy darker than the picture shows &amp; it also came wonky but its pretty,It looks like I actually bedazzled my phone.  The case is better than what I expected ... it is so cute.  Yes, I would recommend this case.,this is the most cutest case i've ever bought from here , i just got it today .. it took a really long time,which is weird cause it took almost two months. but i didn't care. i thought that it was gonna fall apart. but it didn't it really held up nicely. &amp; i am thinking about ordering the other ones that come in pink &amp; black. these are really classy &amp; rich looking for only 2 bucks you can not go wrong. its so girly,even though i don't like too much stuff going on,on my cases. this i perfect, i haven't tried fitting it in my pocket but i will  sooo. you should definatley buy this.,It is so cute!  Love the bling and love the pink!  It is such a cute case and I get many compliments.,This case is soo super pretty! This case may look very breakable but it is very sturdy. It is super cute, the case looks cuter in real life than the picture. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? GET IT!!!,For the price i received a pretty great case! I received many compliments on how cute it was! the bow on the back looked like it might fall out but i have had it for 6 months and nope, its strongly attached! the diamonds in the back amazed me how long they stayed attached and only like 3 have fallen off, not too bad. it fits nicely on my phone. but i don't recommend dropping your phone because it doesn't give you protection from impacts! its more like a \"look at my pretty phone\" kind of case. Unfortunately i had to replace my case because due to my crazy lifestyle (throwing my phone in bags and pockets) the plastic by the volume buttons started to break off. But i will definitely buy another one to put on my iPhone on special occasions only!,love it!!!!!\\nits gorgeous\\narrived on time i get many compliments on it\\nits definitely a girly case which i love,Beautiful quality and outstanding product! Everyone compliments me on the case and thinks I spent wayy wayy more than I really did :),I love this case. I have plenty of cases but this is 1 of my favs.. I kept this case on longer than any case I have. Sum of the stones fall off but they give u extra. Once I ran out of extras I changed da case.... Lol,Another great product that my daughter she use it for a long time but now she has the iPhone 5c. Transaction went well and fast.,This case was an extremely great deal. The color and design was perfect. This is a great going out on the town case.,crystals fell off as nothing :( that's why I really didn't like it but as soon as I saw it I liked it but the stones,Can not argue with the price or appearance. Looks just like the picture with the exception that it is not white. The jewels do fall off rather easily.,soooo cute! I got many complaints when I had this cover.  I took the gems off at the bottom of the case since texting made it hard.  After awhile, the gems started to peel off..but it still looked cute!,I have used this case for a couple weeks &amp; so far its been great!  All the little blings have stayed in place.  Very sparkly &amp; cute.,The product is recommended for anyone looking to use it or gift it to one of your family members. Thanks,here is another I love as well!!!, I am so happy with my phone cover,, I get so many compliments from other females!!!! but it is my phone that wears it!!!!,I used this case for not even a week and the bow came off. I loved it so pretty, but wish it would of stayed together.,I really love this case... you have to keep your phone face down all the time, but it's pretty good quality. Some stones come off from normal use, unless you keep it in your purse all day.,gotten so many compliments, its so beautiful and simple. i've had it for 3 months now and it still looks brand new,It was a great deal,, I would keep buying !!!!!!!\\nIt was worth the wait\\nHappy happy happy happy happy,Very cheap broke the first time we put it on :( It was pretty but very cheaply made!! Too bad as it is cute,so the case came on time, i love the design. I'm actually missing 2 studs but nothing too noticeable the studding is almost a bit sloppy around the bow, but once again not too noticeable. I haven't put in my phone yet so this is just what I've notice so far,THIS IS A VERY PRETTY 4S CELL PHONE CASE ANS IT IS 3D AND VERY PRETTY, THANK YOU FROM RENE,I ordered this case for my daughter for Christmas because she got an IPhone for Christmas and I wanted her to have a really nice phone case that was different because EVERYBODY has the same IPhone cases. SHE LOVED THIS PHONE CASE FROM THE MOMENT SHE OPENED THE PACKAGE!! I loved the fact that this case came a few days earlier than expected and THE PRICE WAS AMAZING for a really cute 3D IPhone case too.,I purchased this for my grand-daughters phone. She loves it and it is so unique. The quality of the cover is very good.,really pretty! ive had a couple gems come off, but it comes with glue, so its easily fixable. i like it</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was very excited when I first got this case. I loved the color and the feel of it. Then I started noticing stuff on my hands and realized the \"rubber\" peels right off the phone just from normal use. As the saying goes you get what you pay for.,this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.,Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a \"good look\" for their phone.,The case is not white, its more of a silver. It's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.,I didn't like this,good,I wanted to highly recommend this seller&gt;I had a slight issue with the product, and they offered a complete refund without having to send the product back:) I fixed the case, so there was no need for the refund.

       "      <td>Good item,Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.,Good product, good price, fast shipping,I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.,this is a great product, product shipped extreamly fast, no problems or defects with product, recommended buy for anyone. A+,my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didn't see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one.,Very nice case and color too, only that the material is weak and soon broke.\\n\\nThank you very much,This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,Sent case that didn't fit,phone case does not work. the clips may be broken, it does not work. the case is a little scratch and missing paint. it fits my phone but does not stay clipped!,Didn't fit my phone.,The color is more dark in person, and this isn't the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on.,Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.\\nMy wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Great ! So far.\\nI had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short.,This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!\\n\\nupdate:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!,You are saying that you sell a Universal charger but what you sold me was a blasted Blackberry charger! I am so mad right now!! I can't believe this. I was so excited waiting for a charger for my samsung battery charger and all I got was a BLACKBERRY CHARGER. DON'T EVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER.,Good,what can i say? pretty much like all the travel chargers for my galaxy 2 phone. price was the best,I would not recommend getting this charger. I can literally have my phone (samsung galaxy 2) charging for over 6 hours and it will not be fully charged. This is the only charger I have ever bought that sucks like this. Do not buy,Works as advertized...,This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!,so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger.,Shipping on time.  We'll packaged.  Charges like a champ! Definitely will rapid charge the Galaxy 3 with no problems.  Definite must have with a phone happy teenager,Didn't work</td>\n",

       "0  It is such a good case for a low price. I have it on right now and never had any problems with it besides losing about 2 stones since my purchase because I'm rough with it. I recommend it.,I didn't get the same case that's shown in the picture. The case I got had a black and gold bow. Its still cute but not what I wanted. I wanted what was in the picture.,My teenage daughter LOVED this case.  It is really pretty.\\n\\nI only put 4 stars because it does look a little cheap looking, but what do you expect with this much bling. ;o),When you don't want to spend a whole lot of cash but want a great deal...this is the shop to buy from!,I liked it because it was cute, but the studs fall off easily and to protect a phone this would not be recommended. Buy if you just like it for looks.,It's very cute and the stones lasted a long time!  It really makes your phone look a lot more prettier and funnier.,the hirl that wants and needs Hello Kitty products\\nWas so happy that she has a collection to choose from\\nall her friends wants hello kitty phone cases to\\nthanks seller,so cute love this...one drop and its done though...i dropped iton the bathroom floor and it cracked. other then that item is very cute,this case is so cute it looks good on my white iphone its pretty good quality only one diamond has fallen off and its cos i dropped it on the cement. its kinda hard to get off but whatever its so cute and hot and everyone compliments me on it,Happy it,This case is very pretty.  It is very girly looking.  The only problem is it will be hard to put the case in a jeans pocket because the bow does stick out.  It would not be a problem for me as I carry mine in my purse, but my daughters put their phones in their pockets.  Shipping was as described.,Cute case. Jewels do come off but what do you expect. Mine has held up pretty nicely and lost a few stones but is barely noticeable.,Got this for a friend who saw this and liked it. i got it for her, and she liked it. looks good on your iphone and fits well too,it is a beautiful phone case but its also hard to remove & also it the 3d ribbon came wasy darker than the picture shows & it also came wonky but its pretty,It looks like I actually bedazzled my phone.  The case is better than what I expected ... it is so cute.  Yes, I would recommend this case.,this is the most cutest case i've ever bought from here , i just got it today .. it took a really long time,which is weird cause it took almost two months. but i didn't care. i thought that it was gonna fall apart. but it didn't it really held up nicely. & i am thinking about ordering the other ones that come in pink & black. these are really classy & rich looking for only 2 bucks you can not go wrong. its so girly,even though i don't like too much stuff going on,on my cases. this i perfect, i haven't tried fitting it in my pocket but i will  sooo. you should definatley buy this.,It is so cute!  Love the bling and love the pink!  It is such a cute case and I get many compliments.,This case is soo super pretty! This case may look very breakable but it is very sturdy. It is super cute, the case looks cuter in real life than the picture. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? GET IT!!!,For the price i received a pretty great case! I received many compliments on how cute it was! the bow on the back looked like it might fall out but i have had it for 6 months and nope, its strongly attached! the diamonds in the back amazed me how long they stayed attached and only like 3 have fallen off, not too bad. it fits nicely on my phone. but i don't recommend dropping your phone because it doesn't give you protection from impacts! its more like a \"look at my pretty phone\" kind of case. Unfortunately i had to replace my case because due to my crazy lifestyle (throwing my phone in bags and pockets) the plastic by the volume buttons started to break off. But i will definitely buy another one to put on my iPhone on special occasions only!,love it!!!!!\\nits gorgeous\\narrived on time i get many compliments on it\\nits definitely a girly case which i love,Beautiful quality and outstanding product! Everyone compliments me on the case and thinks I spent wayy wayy more than I really did :),I love this case. I have plenty of cases but this is 1 of my favs.. I kept this case on longer than any case I have. Sum of the stones fall off but they give u extra. Once I ran out of extras I changed da case.... Lol,Another great product that my daughter she use it for a long time but now she has the iPhone 5c. Transaction went well and fast.,This case was an extremely great deal. The color and design was perfect. This is a great going out on the town case.,crystals fell off as nothing :( that's why I really didn't like it but as soon as I saw it I liked it but the stones,Can not argue with the price or appearance. Looks just like the picture with the exception that it is not white. The jewels do fall off rather easily.,soooo cute! I got many complaints when I had this cover.  I took the gems off at the bottom of the case since texting made it hard.  After awhile, the gems started to peel off..but it still looked cute!,I have used this case for a couple weeks & so far its been great!  All the little blings have stayed in place.  Very sparkly & cute.,The product is recommended for anyone looking to use it or gift it to one of your family members. Thanks,here is another I love as well!!!, I am so happy with my phone cover,, I get so many compliments from other females!!!! but it is my phone that wears it!!!!,I used this case for not even a week and the bow came off. I loved it so pretty, but wish it would of stayed together.,I really love this case... you have to keep your phone face down all the time, but it's pretty good quality. Some stones come off from normal use, unless you keep it in your purse all day.,gotten so many compliments, its so beautiful and simple. i've had it for 3 months now and it still looks brand new,It was a great deal,, I would keep buying !!!!!!!\\nIt was worth the wait\\nHappy happy happy happy happy,Very cheap broke the first time we put it on :( It was pretty but very cheaply made!! Too bad as it is cute,so the case came on time, i love the design. I'm actually missing 2 studs but nothing too noticeable the studding is almost a bit sloppy around the bow, but once again not too noticeable. I haven't put in my phone yet so this is just what I've notice so far,THIS IS A VERY PRETTY 4S CELL PHONE CASE ANS IT IS 3D AND VERY PRETTY, THANK YOU FROM RENE,I ordered this case for my daughter for Christmas because she got an IPhone for Christmas and I wanted her to have a really nice phone case that was different because EVERYBODY has the same IPhone cases. SHE LOVED THIS PHONE CASE FROM THE MOMENT SHE OPENED THE PACKAGE!! I loved the fact that this case came a few days earlier than expected and THE PRICE WAS AMAZING for a really cute 3D IPhone case too.,I purchased this for my grand-daughters phone. She loves it and it is so unique. The quality of the cover is very good.,really pretty! ive had a couple gems come off, but it comes with glue, so its easily fixable. i like it   \n",
       "1  I was very excited when I first got this case. I loved the color and the feel of it. Then I started noticing stuff on my hands and realized the \"rubber\" peels right off the phone just from normal use. As the saying goes you get what you pay for.,this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.,Received this item very quickly. The design is even more vivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a \"good look\" for their phone.,The case is not white, its more of a silver. It's still a very pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.,I didn't like this,good,I wanted to highly recommend this seller>I had a slight issue with the product, and they offered a complete refund without having to send the product back:) I fixed the case, so there was no need for the refund. Thanks for being an honest company!!!!!!

       "2  Good item,Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It's a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a very nice feel to it. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it won't give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.,Good product, good price, fast shipping,I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.,this is a great product, product shipped extreamly fast, no problems or defects with product, recommended buy for anyone. A+,my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didn't see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one.,Very nice case and color too, only that the material is weak and soon broke.\\n\\nThank you very much,This case is afordable and yes it peels very easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,Sent case that didn't fit,phone case does not work. the clips may be broken, it does not work. the case is a little scratch and missing paint. it fits my phone but does not stay clipped!,Didn't fit my phone.,The color is more dark in person, and this isn't the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on.,Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.\\nMy wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone.

       "4  Great ! So far.\\nI had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it's fit firmly in usb and has a short.,This Charger is awesome! First of all I wasn't expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!\\n\\nupdate:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I've had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it's still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!,You are saying that you sell a Universal charger but what you sold me was a blasted Blackberry charger! I am so mad right now!! I can't believe this. I was so excited waiting for a charger for my samsung battery charger and all I got was a BLACKBERRY CHARGER. DON'T EVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER.,Good,what can i say? pretty much like all the travel chargers for my galaxy 2 phone. price was the best,I would not recommend getting this charger. I can literally have my phone (samsung galaxy 2) charging for over 6 hours and it will not be fully charged. This is the only charger I have ever bought that sucks like this. Do not buy,Works as advertized...,This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!,so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger.,Shipping on time.  We'll packaged.  Charges like a champ! Definitely will rapid charge the Galaxy 3 with no problems.  Definite must have with a phone happy teenager,Didn't work                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
